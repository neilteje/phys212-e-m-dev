A point particle of mass \[m\] travels freely in the 
\[x\]-direction with uniform velocity \[v_0\].  At \[x = 0 \], 
it enters a region between two plates oriented perpendicular 
to the \[y-axis\]; the plate spacing is \[w\], and the plate length
in the \[x\]-direction is \[L\].  The particle enters on the 
mid-plane \[y = 0\]. While between the plates, it experiances 
a constant, spatially uniform force \[F\] in the \[+y\]-direction.
After exiting the plates the particle again moves freely.

# (a) 
Ourt first task will be to obtain an expression for the **\[y\]-coordinate** of the point
at which the particle **exits** the plates.  We will assume that the plate spacing is wide 
enough that the particle never strikes either plate.  But before we start, consider these possible
solutions:

\[ y = \frac{ F}{ m(v_0 + L)\]

\[ y = \frac{ FL}{ mv_0}\]

\[ y = \frac{ Fw^2}{ mv_0^2} \]

could any of them be correct?  Why or why not?  Remember, **units** and **limiting behavior**! In
fact, from _only_ those two considerations, you can write down the correct answer to within a 
factor of 2 without using any formulas at all.  Want to git it a try? (This procedure is called
_dimensional analysis_ and physicists use it alll the time, especially when developing new theories.)

 \[\frac{ \frac{ kg * m}{ s^2}(m^2) }{kg( \frac{ m^2}{ s^2}} = m\]

Therefore (3) is the answere.


# (b)

Now go ahead and calculate the correct expression for \[y\].


\[ y = \frac{ 1}{ 2} \frac{ F}{ m} \left( \frac{ L}{ v_0}\right)^2 \]

# (c)

Next, Find an expression for the **maximum value** of the force \[F\] for
which the particle passes through the force region without striking either plate.


\[ F = mw \left( \frac{ v_0}{ L}\right) \]


# (d)

For the conditions of part (c), find an expression for \[ \tan \Theta \] 
where \[ \Theta\] is the **angle of deflection** at which the partical exits 
the force region.  [Did you draw a sketch? Did you check your units?]

\[ \tan \Theta = \frac{ F L}{ m v_0^2} = \frac{ w}{ L} \]
