\[F_{1 \rightarrow 2} = -G \frac{ m_1 m_2}{ r_{12}^2} \hat r_{12}\]

For particle of equal mass \[M\] are fixed at the corners of a square 
with sides of length \[a\].  A fith particle has mass \[m\] and moves 
under the gravitational forces fo the other four.

# (a) 

Find the **\[x\]-compnent and \[y\]-component** of the net gravitational 
force on \[m\] due to the other foure masses when \[m\] is located at
the center of the square [lef-handed figure]

Hint: **Draw a sketch!** Use superposition and draw a vector _diagram_ consisting of
four vectors, each representing the force exerted by one on the corner particles on \[m\].
For ease of reference, label the four [equal] corner masses \[M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4\].  Lable
the corresponding force vectors **\[F_1, F_2\]** etc.  With the fector diagram in hand,
it is vastly easier to calculate the requested componets of the total force.


\[\overrightarrow F  = 0\] 

Each of the masses pull in equal and oposite directions.

# (b)

Find the **\[x\]-compnent and \[y\]-component** of the net gravitational 
force on \[m\] due to the other foure masses when \[m\] is located at
the center point of the right-hand side of the square [middle figure].  
Use the same solution procedure that was recommended above for part (a)

\[ F_y = 0 \]

\[ F_x = - \frac{ 16 GMm}{ 5^{ \frac{ 3}{2}} a^2} \]


# (c)

Check your answer to part (b) by testing at least 3 examples of 
**limiting behavior** Do you get the results you expect?

\[ F_y = 0 \]

\[ F_x = -2GMm \left( \frac{ x - a}{ \left( \frac{ a^2}{ 4} + \left(x - \frac{ a}{ 2}\right)^2 \right)} \frac{ x + a}{ \left( \frac{ a^2}{ 4} + ( a + \frac{ a}{2})^2 \right)^{ \frac{ 3}{2} \right) \]
