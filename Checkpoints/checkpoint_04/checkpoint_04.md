# CheckPoint: Gauss' Law

## Gaussian Surface Choice
You are told to use Gauss' Law to calculate 
the electric field at a distance \[R\] away from 
a charged cube of dimension \[a\]. Which of the 
following Gaussian surfaces is best suited for 
this purpose?

[[gaussian_surface_choice.png]]

* This field cannot be calculated using Gauss' law
  * The \[E\]-field from a charged cube is _not constant_ 
    on any of these surfaces.

## Charged Spherical Shell
A charged spherical insulating shell has inner radius \[a\] 
and outer radius \[b\]. The charge density on the shell is \[\rho\].

What is the magnitude of the \[E\]-field at a distance \[r\] away from the 
center of the shell where \[r < a\]?

* zero
  * I don't know

## Charged Conducting Sphere and Spherical Shell
A positively charged solid conducting sphere is contained within a 
negatively charged conducting spherical shell as shown. The magnitude 
of the total charge on each sphere is the same.

Which of the following statements best describes the electric field 
in the region between the spheres?
* The field points radially outward.
* The field points radially inward.
  * I do not know.
* The field is zero.

## Infinite Sheets of Charge
In both cases shown below, the colored lines represent positive (blue) 
and negative (red) charged planes. The magnitudes of the charge per unit 
area on each plane is the same.

 In which case is the magnitude of the electric field at point P bigger?

* They are the same.
  * I do not know.
