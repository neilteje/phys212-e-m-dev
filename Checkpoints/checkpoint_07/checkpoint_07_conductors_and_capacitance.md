# Checkpoint: Conductors and Capacitance

## Two spherical Conductors 

[[two_spherical_conductors.png]]

### 1)
Two spherical conductors are separated by a large distance. 
They each carry the same positive charge \[Q\]. Conductor \[A\] 
has a larger radius than conductor \[B\].

Compare the potential at the surface of conductor \[A\] with the 
potential at the surface of conductor \[B\].

* \[V_A < V_B\]
  * \[V_B\] is equal to the inverse of the scaler difference between
    the two sperical radii.

### 2)

The two conductors are now connected by a wire. How do the potentials 
at the conductor surfaces compare now?

* \[V_A = V_B\]
  * By connecting the charges through a wire it causes the potential
    charge to equalize.

### 3)
What happens to the charge on conductor \[A\] after it is connected 
to conductor \[B\] by the wire?

* \[Q_A\] increases 
  * Since sphere \[A\] has a greater radius this mean that it has
    a lower charge potential and in turn when the charges potentials
    equalize when the wire is attached the sphere with large radius
    \[A\] with have the scaler multiple of the difference between their
    radii as it's new charge.

## Charged Parallel Plates

Two parallel plates of equal area carry equal and opposite charge \[Q_0\]. 
The potential difference between the two plates is measured to be \[V_0\]. 
An uncharged conducting plate (the green thing in the picture below) is 
slipped into the space between the plates without touching either one. The 
charge on the plates is adjusted to a new value \[Q_1\] such that the 
potential difference between the plates remains the same.

### 1)
Compare \[Q_1\] and \[Q_0\]

* \[Q_1 = Q_2\]
  * Introducing an conductor does not change the charge of the system.

### 3)
Compare the capacitance of the two configurations in the above problem.

* \[C_1 > C_0\]
  * Since \[C \equiv \frac{ Q}{ \Delta V}\] and the potential difference
    is lower in the instance with the conducting plate present it follows
    that the capacitance of the according instance will be higher.
