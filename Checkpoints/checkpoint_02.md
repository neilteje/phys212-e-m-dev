## Field Directions

[[images/checkpoint_02_field_directions.png]]

Two equal, but opposite charges are placed on the \[x\] axis. The 
positive charge is placed at to the left of the origin and the negative 
charge is placed to the right, as shown in the figure above.

### 1)
What is the direction of the electric field at point \[A\]?

* Right
  * The opposite charges cancel along the \[y\] axis while \[+Q\] pushes 
    along the positive \[x\] axis and \[-Q\] pulls allong the positive
    \[x\] axis.

### 2)
What is the direction of the electric field at point \[B\]?

* Left
  * Although the \[+Q\] charge is pushing to the right along the positive \[x\] axis 
    at poiont \[B\], the \[-Q\] is pulling to the left along the negative \[x\] axis
    and hence the direction of the electric field at point \[B\] is leftward.


## Magnitude of Field from Two Charges

[[images/checkpoint_02_magnitude_of_field_from_two_charges.png]]

In which of the two cases is the magnitude of the electric field at the point labeled 
\[A\] the largest?

* The magnitudes are equal
  * In both cases, the point is being acted on by forces in perpendicular directions.
    Case 1, the charge being pushed in along the positive \[x\] axis by \[+Q\] and 
    pulled along the negative \[y\] axis by \[-Q\].  Case 2, the charge is being pushed along
    the postive \[x\] axis by the upper right \[+Q\] charge and pushed along the positive
    \[y\] axis by the bottom right \[+Q\] charge.

## Motion of Test Charge

[[images/checkpoint_02_motion_of_test_charge.png]]

A positive test charge \[q\] is released from rest at distance \[r\] away from \[a\] charge 
of \[+Q\] and a distance \[2r\] away from a charge of \[+2Q\].

How will the test charge move immediately after being released?

* To the right
  * \[ \frac{ Q}{ r^2} > \frac{ 2Q}{ 4r^2} = \frac{ Q}{ 2r} \]

## Electric Fields

Two infinite lines of charge 

[[images/checkpoint_02_two_lines_of_charge.png]]

Both lines have identical charge densities \[+ \lambda \frac{ C}{ m}. Point \[A\] is 
equidistant from both lines and Point \[B\] is located above the top line as shown.

How does \[E_A\], the magnitude of the electric field at point \[A\], compare to \[E_B\], 
the magnitude of the electric field at point \[B\]?

* \[E_A < \[E_B\]
  * Since all force along the \[x\] axis is zero in th field produced by
    infinite line of charge, both lines of chage have an identical charge density,
    and point \[A\] is equidiestant from both lines the magnitude of the force
    at point \[A\] is zero.  The magnitude of the force at point \[B\] is greater
    than zero and therefore \[E_A < \[E_B\].
