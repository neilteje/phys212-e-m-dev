# Forces and Torques on Currents

## Current Loop in a Magnetic Field
A square loop of wire is carrying current in the counterclockwise 
direction. There is a horizontal uniform magnetic field pointing to the right.

### 1)
What is the direction of the net force on the loop?

* The net force on the loop is zero
  * Because it is a loop, the netforce sums to zero

### 2)
In which direction will the loop rotate? (assume the z axis is out of the screen)

* It will not rotate
  * Because the loop is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field the torque
    on the loop is zero.

### 3)
What is the direction of the net torque on the loop?

* The net torque is zero
  * because of how the loop is oriented with respect to the magnetic field the
    net torque on the loop is zero.

## Magnetic Moment in a Magnetic Field

### 1)
Three different orientations of a magnetic dipole moment in a 
constant magnetic field are shown below. Which orientation results 
in the largest magnetic torque on the dipole?

* b
  * At point _b_ the \sin componet of the equation is 1. 

### 2)
Which orientation has the most potential energy?

* c
  * A this point cos component of potential energy is greatest.

### 3)
In order to rotate a horizontal magnetic dipole to the three 
postions shown, which one requires the most work done by the magnetic field?

* b
  * Between the initial point and point b is the greatest change in potential
    energy.
