## Forces on Two Charges
* Two Charges \[ q = + 1 \mu \text{C} \] and \[ Q = +10 \mu \text{C}\] are placed near each other as shown in the figure ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-10%20at%2010.04.03%20PM.png)1) Which of the following diagrams best depicts the forces acting on the charges?
   * C
       * Charge \[q\] is \[frac{ 1}{ 10}\] the magnitude of charge \[Q\] but the charges have an equal and oposite effect on one another.  Therefore, the \[F_{qQ} = F_{Qq}\]

## Compare Forces
* Consider the two cases shown below. In both cases a central charge q has two charges of equal magnitude at equal distances above and below it. In Case 1 the signs of the two outer charges is opposite, and in Case 2 they are both positive. You are not told the sign of the charge in the center q.  ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-11%20at%202.14.27%20AM.png)   In which Case is the magnitude of the net force on the center charge bigger?
   * Case 1
       * In case2 the force of the two \[+Q\] charges cancel one another out as the are push the charge equally in opposite directions.  In case1 \[+Q\] is pushing the charge downward and the \[-Q\] is pulling the charge downward, in turn producing a higher net force on the center charge.

## Force from Four Charges
* A positive charge \[Q\] is placed at the origin. Four other positive charges are placed on a circle in the \[x-y\] plane centered on \[Q\] as shown. The top charge is located on the \[y\] axis and has a magnitude of \[3q\]. The three bottom charges are symmetric about the y axis as shown and each has magnitude \[q\]. ![figure](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11444220/00/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-11%20at%202.22.49%20AM.png)
   * Which of the following statements best describes \[F_X\], the \[x\] component of the net force on the charge at the origin?
       * \[F_x = 0\]
       * The forces along the x-axis sum to zero.
   * For the collection of charges shown in the above problem, which of the following statements best describes \[F_Y\], the \[y\] component of the net force on the charge at the origin?
       * \[F_Y < 0 \]
       * While all force of the \[3q\] is directed along the negative \[y\] axis, some of the force exerted on \[Q\] by two of the \[q\] charges is directed along the \[x\] axis and therefore \[F_N\] is along the negative \[y\] axis.
