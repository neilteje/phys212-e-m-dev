## Flux from Uniformly Charged Rod

An infinitely long charged rod has uniform charge density of \[\lambda\], 
and passes through a cylinder (gray). The cylinder in case 2 has twice 
the radius and half the length compared to the cylinder in case 1.

Compare the magnitude of the flux, \[\phi\], through the surface of the cylinder in both cases.

* \[ \phi_1 = 2 \phi_2\]
  * We are integrating over half the distance to compute the flux.

## Flux from Point Charge Through Surfaces of Sphere

A positive charge (blue) is contained inside a spherical shell (black).

Consider two small surface elements on the shell surface \[d_A\] and \[d_B\], 
located on opposite side of the shell.

### 1)
How does the electric flux through the two surface elements, \[d \phi_A\] and 
\[d \phi_B\] change when the charge is moved from position 1 to position 2?

* \[d \phi_A\] increases and \[d \phi_B\] decreases.
  * The positive charge is closer to \[d_A\] in position 2.

### 2)
How does the flux \[ \phi_E\] through the entire surface change when the charge 
is moved from position 1 to position 2?

* Both \[d \phi_A\] and \[d \phi_B\] do not change.
  * The charge is still contained withing the surface in both cases.

## Field Lines from Two Point Charges

[[images/checkpoint_03_field_lines_from_two_point_charges.png]]

The following three questions pertain to the electric field lines due to two c
harges shown above.

### 1)

Compare the magnitudes of the two charges.

* \[ |Q_1| > |Q_2| \]
  * Looking at the figure, more lines are protruding from charge \[Q_1\].

### 2)

What do we know about the signs of the charges from looking at the picture?

* \[Q_1\] and \[Q_2\] have opposite signs.
  * The electric field lines project directly from on charge to the other,
    indicating oposite signs.


### 3)

Compare the magnitudes of the electric fields at points \[A\] and \[B\].

* \[ |E_A| < |E_B| \]
  * The filed at point \[B\] is more dense with electric field lines, indicating
    a higher magnitude than point \[A\].
