# Checkpoint Ampere's Law

## Amperian Integrals

### 1)
Two loops are placed near identical current carrying 
wires as shown in Case 1 and Case 2 below.

[[q1.png]]

For which case is \[\oint\limits_{loop} \vec B \cdot d \vec l\] greater?
* The integral is the same for both Cases
  * In both cases the current carrying wire is contained within the loop.

### 2)
Two loops are placed near current carrying wires as shown in Case 1 and Case 2 below.

[[q2.png]]

For which case is \[\oint\limits_{loop} \vec B \cdot d \vec l\] greater?
* Case 1
  * Case 2 the current carrying wire is outside the loop and therefore zero.

### 3)
Two loops are placed near current carrying wires as shown in Case 1 and Case 2 
below. In both cases the direction of the current in the two wires are 
opposite to each other.

* Case 2
  * Case 1 the current carrying wires are outside the loop and therefore zero.
  

## Magnetic Field Directions

### 1)
An infinitely long hollow conducting tube carries current I in the direction shown.

[[q4.png]]

What is the direction of the magnetic field inside the tube?
* the magnetic field is zero
  * because it is contained with in the tube the magnetic field is zero

### 2)
A current carrying wire is wrapped around cardboard tube as shown below.

In which direction does the magnetic field point inside the tube?

* right
  * I don't konw.
