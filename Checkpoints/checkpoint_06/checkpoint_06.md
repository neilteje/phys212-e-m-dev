## Spatial Dependence of Potential
The electric potential in a certain region is plotted 
in the following graph

[[spatial_dependence_of_potential.png]]

### 1)
At which point is the magnitude of the \[E\]-field greatest?

* B
  * In order to maximize the \[E\]-field we are looking for the 
    steepest slope or the point at which the electric potential is
    decreasing the fastest

### 2)
At which point is the direction of the \[E\]-field along the negative \[x\]-axis?

* C
  * The slope is increasing and therefore we are gaining potential energy.


## Zero Electric Field
Suppose the electric field is zero in a certain region of space. 
Which of the following statements best describes the electric
potential in this region?

* The electric potential is zero everywhere in this region.
* The electric potential is zero at at least one point in this region.
* The electric potential is constant everywhere in this region.
* There is not enough information given to distinguish which of the above answers is correct.
  * Only knowing that the electric field is zero in one point does not indicate to us enough
    information to say anything about the electric potential.

## Electric Field Lines
The field-line representation of the \[E\]-field in a certain region in 
space is shown below. The dashed lines represent equipotential lines.

### 1)
At which point in space is the \[E\]-field the weakest?

* \[D\]
  * At point \[D\] the field lines are most sparse.

### 2)
Compare the work done moving a negative charge from 
\[A\] to \[B\] and from \[C\] to \[D\]. Which one requires more work?

* More work is required to move a negative charge from \[A\] to \[B\] than from \[C\] to \[D\]
  * Based on the number of intersections of field lines, it is indicated that a greater 
    "distance" exists between \[A\] and \[B\].
* More work is required to move a negative charge from \[C\] to \[D\] than from \[A\] to \[B\]
* The same amount of work is required to move a negative charge 
  from \[A\] to \[B\] as to move it from \[C\] to \[D\]
* Cannot determine without performing the calculation

### 3)
Compare the work done moving a negative charge from \[A\] to \[B\] and 
from \[A\] to \[D\]. Which one requires more work?

* More work is required to move a negative charge from \[A\] to \[B\] than from \[A\] to \[D\]
* More work is required to move a negative charge from \[A\] to \[D\] than from \[A\] to \[B\]
  * The "distance" created by the field is greater from \[A\] to \[D\] vs \[A\] to \[B\]
* The same amount of work is required to move a negative charge from \[A\] to \[B\] as to move it from \[A\] to \[D\]
* Cannot determine without performing the calculation
