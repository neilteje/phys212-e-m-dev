# Magnetism

## Magnetic Forces
Three points are lcated in a uniform magnetic field as shown. 
The \[B\] field points into the screen.

### 1)
A positively charged particle is located at point \[A\] and is 
stationary. The direction of the magnetic force on the particle is:

* Zero 
  * the charge is not moving


### 2)
The positive charge moves from point \[A\] toward \[B\]. The 
direction of the magnetic force on the particle is:

* Left
  * Point your fingers from \[A\] to \[B\] and curling in the direction
    of magnetic field we find the force on the particle is pointing _left_.

## Motion in a Magnetic Field
The drawing below shows the top view of two interconnected chambers. 
Each chamber has a unique magnetic field. A positively charged particle 
is fired into chamber 1, and observed to follow the dashed path shown 
in the figure.

### 1)
What is the direction of the magnetic field in chamber 1?

* out of the into the screen
  * know the direction of the velocity and the force which is being exerted
    on the charged particle we find able to use the right hand rule by pointing
    the thumb in the direction of the force, point the figures toward the 
    initial velocity and then identifying where the fingers curl toward.

## 2)
Compare the magnitude of the magnetic field in chamber 1 to the 
magnitude of the magnetic field in chamber 2.

* \[|B_1| > |B_2|\]
  * The arch of the particle path appears to be larger in the second chamber.
