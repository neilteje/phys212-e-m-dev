## Checkpoint

What is the direction of the electric field at point \[A\]?
* Right

What is the direction of the electric field at point \[B\]?
* Left


## Checkpoint

In which of the two cases shown below is the magnitude of the 
electric field at the point labeled \[A\]
* The will be equal.

# Question
What is the direction of the electric field at point \[P\], 
the unoccupied corner of the square?

* (A) - Up and to the right.
  * \[-q\]
     * \[r = \sqrt{ 2d^2}\]
     * \[\sqrt{ E_x_{-q}^2 + E_y_{-q}^2} = k \left(\frac{ q}{ 2d^2} 
    \cos{ \frac{ \pi}{ 4}}\right)  + k \left(\frac{ q}{ 2d^2} \sin{ \frac{ \pi}{ 4}} \right)\] 
  * \[+q\]s
    * \[
    
  * The \[-q\] charge is \[r = \sqrt{ 2d^2}\] from \[P\] and
    acts on the point with a force of magnitude
