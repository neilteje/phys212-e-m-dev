# Coulomb's Law:w
* Coulomb's Law
  * \[ {\overrightarrow F_{ 12}} = k \frac{ {{q_1}{q_2}}}{ {r_{ 12}^2}} {\hat r_{ 12}}\]
     * \[ F_{ 12} \Rightarrow \] froce by \[q_1\] on \[q_2\]


## problem
Two paperclips are seperated by 10 meters.  Then you remove 1 electron from each atom on the first paperclip and place it on the second one.

Which weight is closest to the approximate force between those paperclips( recall that weight \[= mg, \text{g} = 9.8 \frac{ m}{ s^2}\])

* Mt. Everest \[10^4 \text{kg} \times \text{g}\]
