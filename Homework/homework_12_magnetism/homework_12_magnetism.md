## Motion in B Field
A proton \[(mass= 1.67 \times 10^{-27} kg, charge = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} C)\] travelling with 
\[speed = 1.0 \times 10^6 m/s\] enters a region of space containing a uniform magnetic 
field of \[1.2 T\]. What is the time t required for the proton to reemerge 
into the field-free region?

\[t = \]

## Motion in a Magnetic Field 1
A charged particle of mass \[m = 7.5 \times 10^{-8} kg\], 
moving with constant velocity in the y-direction enters a 
region containing a constant magnetic field \[B = 1.9 T\] 
aligned with the positive z-axis as shown. The particle 
enters the region at \[(x,y) = (0.5 m, 0)\] and leaves the 
region at \[(x,y) = 0, 0.5 m\] a time \[t = 481.0 \mu s\] 
after it entered the region.

### 1)
With what speed \[v\] did the particle enter the region 
containing the magnetic field?
