# Homework: Forces and Torques on Currents

## Loop Work

A wire formed in the shape of an equilateral triangle of side $d = 8.0 cm$, 
carries current $i = 0.25 A$. This loop is located in a region of space that 
contains a constant magnetic field of magnitude $B = 1.3 T$, aligned with the 
negative z-axis as shown in the diagram below.

What is \[W_{I to II}\], the work you would have to do to rotate the coil 180° from 
Position I to Position II? (Note, the coil is rotated out of the plane of 
the page, not simply spun in the plane) 

\[W_{I to II} =\]


## Loop Torque
A uniform magnetic field \[B = 1.8 T\] points in the \[+x\] direction. A square loop with 
sides of length \[d = 20.0 cm, N=12.0 turns\], and current \[I = 0.85 A/turn\] pivots without 
friction around a pin about the \[z\]-axis as shown in the figure below.(The \[z\]-axis points 
out of the page in the left hand panel.)

A mass M is hung from one side of the loop (C or D), and the loop is in equilibrium when it 
makes an angle of 30.0° with respect to the x-z plane. Determine the size of the mass. Enter 
a positive number if it is hung from C and a negative number if it is hung from D. M =
