# Infinite Charged Sheet and Infinite Conducting Slab

An infinite sheet of charge, oriented perpendicular to the \[x\]-axis, 
passes through \[x = 0\]. It has a surface charge density 
\[\sigma_1 = -4.1 \mu C/m2\]. A thick, infinite conducting slab, 
also oriented perpendicular to the \[x\]-axis occupiees the region 
between \[a = 2.5 cm\] and \[b = 4.8 cm\]. The conducting slab has 
a net charge per unit area of \[sigma_2 = 73.0 \mu C/m2\].

## 1)
What is \[E_x( P)\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric 
field at point \[P\], located a distance \[8.2 cm\] from the infinite sheet of charge?
