[[cylinder.png]]

Two coaxial cylindrical conductors are shown in perspective and cross-section above. 
The inner cylinder has radius \[a = 2.0 cm\], length \[L = 10.0 m\] and carries a 
total charge of \[Q_{inner} = + 8.0 nC\] where \[1 nC = 10-9 C\]. The outer cylinder 
has an inner radius \[b = 6.0 cm\], outer radius \[c = 7.0 cm\], length \[L = 10.0 m\] 
and carries a total charge of \[Q_{outer} = - 16.0 nC\] . What is \[E_x\], the 
\[x\]-component of the electric field at point P which is located at the midpoint of 
the length of the cylinders at a distance \[r = 4.0 cm\] from the origin and makes 
an angle of \[30.0^\circ\] with the \[x\]-axis?

* Let
  * \[a = 2.0 cm = 0.02 m\]
      * Inner solid cylinder radius
  * \[b = 6.0 cm = 0.06 m\]
      * Outer cylinder inner radius
  * \[c = 7.0 cm = 0.07 m\]
      * Ourter cylinder outer radius
  * \[L = 10.0 m\]
      * The length of each of the cylindars
  * \[Q_{inner} = 8.0 n C\]
      * total charge of the inner cylinder
  * \[Q_{outer} = -16.0 n C\]
      * total charge of teh outer cylinder
  * \[r = 4.0 cm = 0.04 m\]
      * distance from the origin to the point
* Given
  * \[E = \frac{ \lambda}{ 2 \pi \varepsilon_0 r}\]
      * Electric Filed, line of charge
* \[E_x = \frac{ \frac{ Q_{inner}}{ L}}{ 2 \pi \varepsilon_0 r} = 311.485 \frac{ N}{ C}\]
