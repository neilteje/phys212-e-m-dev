# Point Charge and Charged Sphere

A point charge \[q_1 = -8.5 \mu C\] is located at the center 
of a thick conducting shell of inner radius \[a = 2.8 cm\] 
and outer radius \[b = 4.1 cm\], The conducting shell has 
a net charge of \[q_2 = 2.1 \mu C\].

  * \[r = b\]
* \[ \sigma_a = -\left(\frac{ q_1}{ 4 \pi a^2}\right) = .000402 \frac{ C}{ m^2}\]

## 7)
For how many values of \[ x: (4.1 cm < x < \infty)\] is it true that \[E_x = 0\]?

* none
  * The field is treated as if it is a single point charge outside the conducting
    wall and there after extends to infinity diminishing by a rate of \[r^2\].


## 8)
Define \[E_2\] to be equal to the magnitude of the electic field at \[r = 1.4 cm\] 
when the charge on the outer shell \[q_2\] is equal to \[2.1 \mu C\]. Define \[E_0\] 
to be equal to the magnitude of the electric field at \[r = 1.4 cm\] if the charge 
on the outer shell \[q_2\] were changed to \[0\]. Compare \[E_2\] and \[E_0\].

* \[E_2 = E_0\]
  * The fields are equal as the charge on the outer shell does not effect 
    the field on within the shell.
