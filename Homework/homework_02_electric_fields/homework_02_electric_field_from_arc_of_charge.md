# Electric Field from Arc of Charge
A total charge \[Q = -2.0 \mu C\] is distributed 
uniformly over a quarter circle arc of radius \[a = .095 m\] as shown.

## 1)

What is \[\lambda\] the linear charge density along the arc?

* \[2 \pi r\]
  * Circumfrerence
* Let
  * \[ r = a = .095 m\]

* \[\lambda = \frac{ k \frac{ Q}{ r^2}}{  \frac{ 1}{ 2} \pi r}\]
  * It says I made a power of ten error, what I am doing wrong?

# 2)
What is \[E_x\], the value of the \[x\]-component of the electric 
field at the origin \[(x, y) = (0,0)\] ?


need to use \[\vec E = \int{ \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{ \hat r}{ r^2} dq}\] and convert it to polar coodinates \[\lambda r f \theta\]

\[\int{ \frac{ k}{ a^2} \hat r d q} 
= \int\limits_0^{\frac{ \pi}{ 2}}{ \frac{ k}{ a^2} \left( -\hat x \cos \theta, -\hat y \sin \theta\right) \frac{ 2q}{\pi a} a d \theta}
= \frac{ k}{ a^2} \frac{ 2q}{ \pi}( -\hat x -\hat y) 
= \frac{ k}{ a^2} \frac{ 2^{\frac{ 3}{ 2}} q}{ \pi} \left( \frac{ -\hat x}{ \sqrt{ 2}}, \frac{ -\hat y}{ \sqrt{ 2}}\right)\]


# 3)
What is \[E_y\], the value of the \[y\]-component of the 
electric field at the origin \[(x,y) = (0,0)\]?

# 4)
How does the magnitude of the electric field at the origin for 
the quarter-circle arc you have just calculated comnpare to the 
electric field at the origin produced by a point charge 
\[Q = -2.0 \mu C\] located a distance \[a = 0.095 m\] from the 
origin along a \[45^\circ\] line as shown in the figure?

* The magnitude of the field from the point charge is greater than 
  that from the quarter-arc of charge
  * The field from the point charge is just given by 
    \[E_{point} = \frac{ k Q}{a^2}\]. You can find the magnitude 
    of the field from the arc of charge from you answers to b) and c). 
    Namely, \[E_{arc} = \frac{ k Q}{ a^2} \frac{ 2 \sqrt{2}}{ \pi}\]. 
    Therefore, the field from the point charge is larger than the 
    field from the arc by a factor of \[ \frac{ \pi}{ 2 \sqrt{2}}\].

What is the magnitude of the electric field at the origin produced 
by a semi-circular arc of charge \[= -4.0 \mu C\], twice the charge 
of the quarter-circle arc?
