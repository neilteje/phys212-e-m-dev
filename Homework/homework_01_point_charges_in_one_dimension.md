# Point Charges in One Dimension

A point chare \[q_1 = -3.4 \mu C \] is located at the origin of a coordinate system.
Another point charge \[q_2 = 6.6 \mu C\] is located along the \[x\]-axis at a distance
\[x_2 = 9.5 cm\] from \[q_1\].

## 1)

What is \[F_{12,x}\], the value of the \[x\] component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
  * \[ \mu = 10^{-6}\]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[r = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]
* \[F_{ij,x} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} = -22.6917 N\]

Charge \[q_2\] is now displaced a distance \[y_2 = 2.9 cm\] in the positive \[y\]-direction. What is 
the new value for the \[x\]-component of the force that \[q_1\] exerts on \[q_2\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
  * \[ \mu = 10^{-6}\]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[x_2 = x = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]
  * \[y_2 = y = 2.9 cm = .029 m\]
  * \[r = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2} = .09932774 m\]
  * \[\theta_{xr} = \arctan{ \left( \frac{ x}{ y} \right)} = 16.9755^\circ\]
* \[F_{ij,x} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \cos{ \left( \theta_{xr} \right)} = -19.853 N\]

A third point charge \[q_3\] is now positioned halfway between \[q_1\] and \[q_2\]. The net force 
on \[q_2\] now has a magnitude of \[F_{2,net} = 6.9 N\] and points away from \[q_1\] and \[q_3\]. What is the value 
(sign and magnitude) of the charge \[q_3\]?

* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \hat r\]
  * \[ \kappa = \frac{ 1}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \frac{ Nm^2}{ C^2} \]
  * \[ \mu = 10^{-6}\]
* Let:
  * \[q_1 = q_i = -3.4 \mu C\]
  * \[q_2 = q_j = 6.7 \mu C \]
  * \[x_2 = x = 9.5 cm = .095 m\]
  * \[y_2 = y = 2.9 cm = .029 m\]
  * \[r = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2} = .09932774 m\]
  * \[\theta_{xr} = \theta = \arctan{ \left( \frac{ x}{ y} \right)} = 16.9755^\circ\]
* \[F_{ij,x} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} \cos{ \left( \theta \right)} = -19.853 N\]
* \[F_{ij} = \kappa \frac{ q_i q_j}{ r^2} = -20.754 N\]

* Let:
  * \[q_3 = q_k = ? C \]
  * \[F_{2,net} = F_{j,net} = 6.9 N \]
* \[F_{kj} = \left| F_{j,net} - F_{ij} \right| = 27.6574 N \]
  * We subtract since \[F_{ij}\] points toward \[q_i\] and \[F_{j,net}\] points away from \[q_i\] and \[q_j\].
* \[F_{kj} = \kappa \frac{ q_k q_j}{ \left( \frac{ r}{ 2} \right)^2} = 1.13255\]
  * Solve for \[q_k\]

## 4)

How would you change \[q_1\] (keeping \[q_2\] and \[q_3\] fixed) in order to make the net force on \[q_2\] equal to zero?
* Increase its magnitude and change its sign
* Decrease its magnitude and change its sign
* Increase its magnitude and keep its sign the same
  * It need to conterbalance \[F_{kj}\] which is \[F_{kj}> F_{ij\]
* Decrease its magnitude and keep its sign the same
* There is no change you can make to q1 that will result in the fet force on q2 being equal to zero.

## 4)

How would you change \[q_3\] (keeping \[q_1\] and \[q_2\] fixed) in order to make the net force on \[q_2\] equal to zero?
* Increase its magnitude and change its sign
* Decrease its magnitude and change its sign
* Increase its magnitude and keep its sign the same
* Decrease its magnitude and keep its sign the same
  * It need to balance \[F_{ij}\] which is \[F_{ij}< F_{kj\]
* There is no change you can make to \[q_3\] that will result in the fet force on \[q_2\] being equal to zero.
